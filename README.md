# neuralnet
Version 0.3
## An Artificial Neural Network framework for Pure Data
[neuralnet] is an artificial neural network Pd external, written in pure C, without any dependencies. It is inspired by the book "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python" by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel KukieÅ‚a. It is an attempt to translate the Python code to C with the Pure Data API, to run neural networks within Pd.

[neuralnet] creates densely connected neural networks for classification, regression, and binary logistic regression. There are different activation functions and optimizers you can set, and various other settable parameters. The object's help patch and the examples found in the examples directory should cover all the necessary information.

## Note about Make
This repository uses the pd-lib-builder Makefile system. You can get it from [here](https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder). The directory of the Makefile should be in the same directory of the neuralnet directory. For example, run:
```
cd ../
git clone https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder.git
cd -
```

## Note about the examples
Example 03-mouse_input.pd uses [mousestate] from the Cyclone library, to get the coordinates of the mouse.
Example 04-mnist_digits.pd uses the [command] external, plus some Python scripts (called via [command]).
Example 05-audio_autoencoder.pd uses [command], though it is not necessary to use it, see patch for details.

All external objects used in the examples can be installed via the deken plugin (Help->Find externals).

Log:<br />
- Added four new activation functions
- Added the ability to access the inner structure of a network (e.g. the latent space)
- Created an audio autoencoder example
- Added a signal-rate version of the object

Special thanks to Ben Wesch for providing macOS and Windows binaries, IOhannes m zmoelnig and Cristof Ressi, for helping out through Pd's mailing list.
